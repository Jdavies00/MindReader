    requirements


need to have pesudo code

use javascript to  show the animation transistions 
 
show the state managment for each step  of the single page app (view 1,2,3..) without refreshing the page 
    do this be creating a single index.html
        the html may wrk best as a card 
        or maybe eaiser as just a page to pull and push too

need a funtion to creat randomnes

                                            function random(min, max) {
                                            const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
                                            return num;
                                            }


    Ideally this could all be done in js and loaded to html  as a json file 
        create objects that change the state of what is being viewed

the restart button must not refresh the page, only refresh the state of the mind reader
     do this with a function to change the state of the page 
     ---
     for this use a function to update the state

     state.prototype.update = function(){
         if((some condition is true)){
             then do this 
         }
     }

     

use the icons of my choice 

all multi of 9 should be the same symbol
    all muti of 9 should be the same symbol
         this is how the trick is done 

again only use on page of html the onlything that changes is the a "state" = variable that only stores the the current view to display 



function that chooses random charature make and arry for all random on key then gen randome number multi but 1000
group all the ones devisi by 9 together 



NewdoCode

style the html 
 nope dont do that ---------<canvas width="1920" height="520"></canvas>  do this to "canvas" the page and remove the scrool bar

 create a hearder 
 creata a subheader
 a var for the chars[] of 10 char
 var dor the state= state 1
 empty var for the selceted system that willl be filled by the funtion as needed this is the update system    &&*&*&*&*&&&&*!&&!*&@& AHHA moment

function for randomenes(){
    var right answer = char[Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)];            *****randomly selet a index in the char array using the math.random * 10-the number of items in the array rounded down
    var str = " ";                                                      creat a var string to addlater

    for(i = 0; i<= 99, i++){                                            for i =0; aslong as 9<= 99; add 1
        if (i % 9){                                                         if 9 ca be divide and leave a remainder % devides and leaves a remainder if there is one
            var reemainder = char[Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)]          ****** may be able to make the right anser var global and reuse it for the reeemainder var - do not do this 
        }   str = str + i + "-"+ remainder + <br>                                                  
    }

            str = str + i + " - " + rightAns + "<br>"
            selectedSym = rightAns
